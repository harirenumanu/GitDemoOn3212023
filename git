this is the demo regarding the git reset.
git init
git status
git add . 
git commit -m "made changes in git in helm"
git remote add origin repo_name
git push origin master
git log ----> to check the latest logs q
git branch dev -----> to create a branch
git checkout -b dev ----> to create and into branch. 
I am again practicing the git reset and revert. second commit 

I am again changing the things to practice reset and revert third commit. 

Case1:
------
1. You are writing code in dev branch but unfortunately you are changed to feauture. 
2. you are entered git add . and git commit -m "added changes".
3. Then the changes whatever you want to add in dev branch will be applied in feauture branch. 
4. Eventhough you are came to again they wont appear. 


I made a change becoz of git reset.

This is regarding merge conficts 

git checkout dev 
git merge master 

from above two line you came to know that you are merging master into dev. 

when you made changes for the 
same file and in that same line in two brances. Now you are trying to merge those branches.
there will be a chance to get merge conflicts. 

This is becoz git dont have an idea which version to include
