this is the demo regarding the git reset.
git init
git status
git add . 
git commit -m "made changes in git in helm"
git remote add origin repo_name
git push origin master
git log ----> to check the latest logs q
git branch dev -----> to create a branch
git checkout -b dev ----> to create and into branch. 
I am again practicing the git reset and revert. second commit 

I am again changing the things to practice reset and revert third commit. 

Case1:
------
1. You are writing code in dev branch but unfortunately you are changed to feauture. 
2. you are entered git add . and git commit -m "added changes".
3. Then the changes whatever you want to add in dev branch will be applied in feauture branch. 
4. Eventhough you are came to again they wont appear. 


I made a change becoz of git reset.
