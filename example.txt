This is regarding merge conficts 

git checkout dev 
git merge master 

from above two line you came to know that you are merging master into dev. 

when you made changes for the 
same file and in that same line in two brances. Now you are trying to merge those branches.
there will be a chance to get merge conflicts. 

This is becoz git dont have an idea which version to include
